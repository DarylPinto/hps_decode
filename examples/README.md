## Examples

### audio_playback
The most common use case for this crate is likely listening to a song contained within an `.hps` file. Run this example to hear a song (using [`rodio`](https://docs.rs/rodio/0.21.1/rodio/) for playback)
```sh
cargo run --example audio_playback --features rodio-source
```
